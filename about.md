I like taking photos and [posting them](https://www.instagram.com/ctina.hung/). I sometimes [tweet](https://twitter.com/cjtinah). Puppies are [cute](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CswfUa-VUAAf0Uq.jpg).

## current reading list
  * [Sapiens](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095) (been trying to read this for 2 months, but somehow eternally stuck in the first 30 pages)
  * [The Signal and the Noise](https://www.amazon.com/Signal-Noise-Many-Predictions-Fail-but/dp/0143125087/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1505453643&sr=1-1&keywords=the+signal+and+the+noise) ([538](http://fivethirtyeight.com/), need I say more?)
  * [Lean In](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Women-Work-Will-Lead/dp/0385349947/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1505453656&sr=1-1&keywords=lean+in) (probably should have read this by now.. but sometimes self-help books can be amazingly dry)

## recommends
  * [Know-It-All](https://www.amazon.com/Know-All-Humble-Become-Smartest/dp/0743250621/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1505453699&sr=1-1&keywords=know+it+all) (hilarious, if you're looking for a good laugh)
